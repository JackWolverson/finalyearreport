\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:Conclusion}

This chapter will summaries this projects outcomes and conclude on the conclude of the results from this body of work. The future work section will also highlight and further improvements or research that could take place with more time and resources. 


\section{Conclusions}
This section will see if the project objectives have been met and what chapter they were met. From the literature review it was apparent that knowledge of research into this filed would be pinnacle to producing the research artefact software. And meeting all objectives may be a difficult task, but as seen below the objectives for this project were all successfully achieved.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Objective one and two was met during the literature review. See chapter \ref{ch:Literature Review} for the literature review where these objectives were met
    \item The third objective was met during the literature review during chapter \ref{ch:Literature Review}. But the method found was not used as the data set was collected from a website (see chapter \ref{ch:Data}) instead of being scraped from the internet.
    \item Objective 4 was met during the implementation stage (chapter \ref{ch:Implementation}). It was successfully met as there were many models implemented that predicted the outcome of a sporting event, in particular a horse race.
    \item After evaluation techniques were collected in chapter \ref{ch:Literature Review}, they were used to evaluate in chapter \ref{ch:Evaluation}. Meaning objective five has been achieved. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}
Some of the further research and improvements are within this section. The model could be improved by allowing an input of raw data that has never been seen before, preprocessing it, then running a prediction against the trained model to then predict the winner of that race. This could be a future race that has not happened yet. As well as predicting the horse as a winner the system could give a probability of that horse winning. Further research could be done into the hyper parameters the model could have to help optimize and improve the model.
