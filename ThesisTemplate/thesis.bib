abstract="The experimental analysis on the performance of a proposed method is a crucial and necessary task to carry out in a research. This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of the results in the field of genetics-based machine Learning. It presents a study involving a set of techniques which can be used for doing a rigorous comparison among algorithms, in terms of obtaining successful classification models. Two accuracy measures for multi-class problems have been employed: classification rate and Cohen's kappa. Furthermore, two interpretability measures have been employed: size of the rule set and number of antecedents. We have studied whether the samples of results obtained by genetics-based classifiers, using the performance measures cited above, check the necessary conditions for being analysed by means of parametrical tests. The results obtained state that the fulfillment of these conditions are problem-dependent and indefinite, which supports the use of non-parametric statistics in the experimental analysis. In addition, non-parametric tests can be satisfactorily employed for comparing generic classifiers over various data-sets considering any performance measure. According to these facts, we propose the use of the most powerful non-parametric statistical tests to carry out multiple comparisons. However, the statistical analysis conducted on interpretability must be carefully considered.",

 abstract = {ABSTRACT:The relative abilities of 2, dimensioned statistics—the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE)—to describe average model-performance error are examined. The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},

abstract="Web mining refers to the whole of data miningand related techniques that are used toautomatically discover and extract informationfrom web documents and services. When used in abusiness context and applied to some type ofpersonal data, it helps companies to builddetailed customer profiles, and gain marketingintelligence. Web mining does, however, pose athreat to some important ethical values likeprivacy and individuality. Web mining makes itdifficult for an individual to autonomouslycontrol the unveiling and dissemination of dataabout his/her private life. To study thesethreats, we distinguish between `content andstructure mining' and `usage mining.' Webcontent and structure mining is a cause forconcern when data published on the web in acertain context is mined and combined withother data for use in a totally differentcontext. Web usage mining raises privacyconcerns when web users are traced, and theiractions are analysed without their knowledge.Furthermore, both types of web mining are oftenused to create customer files with a strongtendency of judging and treating people on thebasis of group characteristics instead of ontheir own individual characteristics and merits(referred to as de-individualisation). Althoughthere are a variety of solutions toprivacy-problems, none of these solutionsoffers sufficient protection. Only a combinedsolution package consisting of solutions at anindividual as well as a collective level cancontribute to release some of the tensionbetween the advantages and the disadvantages ofweb mining. The values of privacy andindividuality should be respected and protectedto make sure that people are judged and treatedfairly. People should be aware of theseriousness of the dangers and continuouslydiscuss these ethical issues. This should be ajoint responsibility shared by web miners (bothadopters and developers), web users, andgovernments.",
