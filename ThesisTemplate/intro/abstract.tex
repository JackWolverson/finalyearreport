\prefacesection{Abstract}
Neural Networks use in sports prediction has gone on for many years. This research project will investigate how various machine learning techniques could be utilised to create predictive models for the outcome of sporting events, with a particular focus on racing. The model/s produced will then be tested and evaluated to measure the effectiveness and measure how successful the models are at the task determined. The conclusion of this report will draw upon the research an give a final few words on the projects research and the research artefact, as well as, looking at any further research that could take place.
