   1 &  open data set  & test that the pandas read csv opens the data set correctly and returns it as the correct type & The data set is opened and a data frame is returned & as expected & pass  \cr
   2 &  label encoder & test that all labels are encoded and no stings are left & no strings are left all labels are encoded & as expected & pass  \cr
   3 & data split & see if train test split correctly splits the data set & the training set has 90 \% of the data in  & as expected & pass  \cr
   4 & Normalise & Normalising the data is correctly executed & all data is normalised & as expected & pass  \cr
   5 & training the model  & the model is trained and no errors occur during this phase  & a trained model & as expected  & pass  \cr
   6 & test the prediction & the model give a valid prediction after being given values that should give a 100\% accuracy & the prediction is 100\% accurate & as expected & pass
